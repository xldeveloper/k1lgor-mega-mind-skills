### Prioritization Matrix

```markdown
## Priority Matrix (RICE)

| Feature   | Reach | Impact | Confidence | Effort  | RICE Score |
| --------- | ----- | ------ | ---------- | ------- | ---------- |
| Feature A | 1000  | 3      | 80%        | 2 weeks | 120        |
| Feature B | 500   | 2      | 90%        | 1 week  | 90         |
| Feature C | 2000  | 1      | 70%        | 3 weeks | 47         |

RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

Higher score = Higher priority
```
