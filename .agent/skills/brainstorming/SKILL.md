# Brainstorming Skill

## When to Use

- Starting a new feature or project
- Making architectural decisions
- Exploring multiple implementation approaches
- Solving complex problems with no obvious solution
- Deciding between competing technologies or patterns

## When NOT to Use

- The solution is already decided and approved — don't brainstorm just for the appearance of process
- The task is purely mechanical (e.g., renaming a variable, fixing a typo) where there is only one sensible approach
- You are mid-execution of an approved plan — re-opening the approach decision mid-build creates scope drift
- The problem is fully defined with explicit implementation instructions from the user — go straight to planning

## Instructions

### Step 0: Search First (MANDATORY)

Before generating any approaches, invoke `search-first` to check:

1. **Does a library already solve this?** (npm, PyPI, GitHub)
2. **Is there an MCP server for this?** (avoids custom integration work)
3. **Does a skill in this system already address this?** (check existing skills)

> Brainstorming approaches that have obvious existing solutions is wasteful. Knowing what's available changes which approaches are even worth considering.

Once search is complete, include in your output:

```
**Existing Solutions Found:**
- [package/tool]: [what it covers and what it doesn't]
- None found for [specific aspect]
```

### Step 1: Understand the Problem Space

Before generating solutions, thoroughly understand the problem:

1. **Define the problem clearly**
   - What are we trying to solve?
   - What are the success criteria?
   - What constraints exist?

2. **Identify stakeholders and requirements**
   - Who will use this?
   - What are their needs?
   - What are the non-negotiables?

3. **Research existing solutions**
   - What has been tried before?
   - What worked? What didn't?
   - Are there industry standards or best practices?

### Step 2: Generate Multiple Approaches

Create at least 3 different approaches:

```
## Approach A: [Name]
- **Description**: Brief summary
- **Pros**: List of advantages
- **Cons**: List of disadvantages
- **Complexity**: Low/Medium/High
- **Time estimate**: Rough estimate
- **Risk level**: Low/Medium/High
```

### Step 3: Evaluate Approaches

For each approach, consider:

1. **Technical Feasibility**
   - Can this be implemented with current tech stack?
   - Are there any blockers?
   - What dependencies are needed?

2. **Maintainability**
   - How easy will this be to maintain?
   - What's the learning curve for the team?
   - How well does it scale?

3. **Performance Impact**
   - What's the runtime cost?
   - What's the memory footprint?
   - Are there any bottlenecks?

4. **Risk Assessment**
   - What could go wrong?
   - What are the unknowns?
   - How can risks be mitigated?

### Step 4: Present Options and Wait for Selection

After evaluation:

1. **Present all evaluated approaches** with their scores
2. **State your recommended approach** with clear rationale
3. **STOP — ask the user to confirm which approach to use**

This is the **only mandatory pause in the workflow**. Because multiple approaches have been considered, the user must explicitly choose before anything is planned or built.

End every brainstorming session with this block:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
⏸️  BRAINSTORMING COMPLETE — PLEASE CHOOSE AN APPROACH
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

I've evaluated [N] approaches above.
My recommendation is: **Approach [X]** — [one-line reason]

Which approach should I proceed with?
  → Reply with the approach name or letter (e.g. "A", "Approach B", "go with Redis")
  → Or say "change X" if you'd like adjustments to any option first

Once you choose, I'll move straight into planning and implementation.
```

Do NOT write any code, create any files, or proceed to the next skill until the user has replied with their chosen approach.

## Example Usage

**Input**: "I need to implement a caching layer for our API"

**Output**:

```markdown
# Brainstorming Session: API Caching Layer

## Problem Statement

Our API is experiencing high latency under load. We need to implement a caching layer to reduce response times and database load.

## Requirements

- [x] Reduce average response time by 50%
- [x] Handle 10,000 requests/second
- [x] Support cache invalidation
- [x] Work with existing infrastructure

## Approaches Considered

### Approach A: Redis Cache

**Description**: Use Redis as a distributed cache
**Pros**: High performance, supports TTL, pub/sub for invalidation
**Cons**: Additional infrastructure, memory costs
**Score**: 8/10

### Approach B: In-Memory Cache (Node-cache)

**Description**: Use in-memory caching within the application
**Pros**: Simple, no extra infrastructure
**Cons**: Doesn't scale horizontally, lost on restart
**Score**: 5/10

### Approach C: CDN Edge Caching

**Description**: Use CloudFlare or similar for edge caching
**Pros**: Fast for static content, reduces origin load
**Cons**: Less control, harder to cache dynamic content
**Score**: 6/10

## Recommendation

**Selected**: Approach A (Redis Cache)
**Rationale**: Best balance of performance, scalability, and control. Team has Redis experience.
**Next Steps**:

1. Set up Redis instance
2. Implement cache layer
3. Add cache invalidation logic
   **Assumptions**:

- Budget available for Redis hosting
- Team can manage Redis operations
```

## Tips

- Don't jump to the first solution that comes to mind
- Consider the long-term implications, not just immediate needs
- Involve relevant stakeholders when appropriate
- Document the decision-making process for future reference
- Be willing to revisit decisions if new information emerges

## Self-Verification Checklist

- [ ] At least 3 distinct approaches generated: `grep -c "^### Approach\|^## Option\|^### Option" brainstorm.md` returns >= 3
- [ ] `search-first` was invoked before generating approaches — existing solutions documented and `grep -c "search-first" task.md` returns > 0
- [ ] Trade-offs documented for every approach: `grep -c "pros\|cons\|tradeoff\|trade-off" brainstorm.md` returns >= 3
- [ ] A recommendation is stated with explicit rationale — `grep -c "Recommendation\|recommend\|chosen" brainstorm.md` returns > 0
- [ ] The mandatory user confirmation gate is present — no code or files written before user selects an approach
- [ ] The chosen approach is recorded in the session output or task.md

## Success Criteria

This skill is complete when: 1) at least 3 meaningfully distinct approaches have been evaluated with trade-offs documented, 2) `search-first` has confirmed there is no existing library or tool that makes the problem trivial, and 3) the user has explicitly selected an approach before any planning or implementation begins.

## Anti-Patterns

- Never skip the brainstorming phase and jump directly to implementation because the first solution that comes to mind is rarely optimal and early commitment to a weak approach compounds into expensive rework.
- Never allow brainstorming to continue indefinitely without a hard time-box because an unbounded session produces more options than can be evaluated and leaves the agent in an open loop with no decision made.
- Never evaluate options during the generation phase because premature evaluation anchors the session on early ideas and suppresses the divergent thinking that produces non-obvious solutions.
- Never use the brainstorm output as the final plan without a separate narrowing step because raw brainstorm output is a list of candidates, not a ranked decision, and handing it to execution causes the executor to make the narrowing decision implicitly.
- Never brainstorm only the happy path because a solution that fails to account for error cases, edge inputs, and adversarial conditions will require a second brainstorm after the first implementation fails.
- Never record brainstorm output in a format that cannot be referenced later because decisions made during brainstorming that are not persisted will be re-litigated in every subsequent phase, wasting time that was already spent.

## Failure Modes

| Failure | Cause | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| Session produces ideas but no decision made, leaving agent in open loop | Brainstorm phase never transitions to evaluation/narrowing phase | Set a hard time-box; end every brainstorm with an explicit "narrow to N options" step |
| All options evaluated as equal, blocking progress | Criteria not defined before evaluation; agent avoids commitment | Define decision criteria (cost, risk, reversibility) before generating options |
| Brainstorm output used as final plan without narrowing | Output handed directly to execution without a selection step | Treat brainstorm output as raw material; always run a separate "pick and justify" step |
| Time-boxed exploration skipped, jumping straight to implementation | Pressure to ship overrides structured thinking | Enforce brainstorm as a mandatory phase gate; record why it was skipped if bypassed |
| Only happy path explored, missing edge cases that block implementation | Agent anchors on positive scenarios; adversarial thinking not prompted | Explicitly prompt for failure scenarios, edge cases, and worst-case outcomes as a separate brainstorm round |
