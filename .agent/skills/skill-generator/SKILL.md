## Skill Creation Process

### Step 1: Identify the Need

```markdown
## Skill Need Assessment

**Problem:** What specific problem does this skill solve?

**Frequency:** How often will this skill be needed?

- [ ] Frequently (daily)
- [ ] Occasionally (weekly)
- [ ] Rarely (monthly)

**Complexity:** How complex is the task?

- [ ] Simple (can be explained briefly)
- [ ] Medium (needs structured approach)
- [ ] Complex (needs detailed steps)

**Decision:** Is this worth a new skill?

- If the task is unique and will be repeated: YES
- If similar to existing skill: Enhance existing
- If one-time task: Skip skill creation
```

### Step 2: Define Scope

```markdown
## Skill Scope Definition

**Skill Name:** (kebab-case, descriptive)

**Description:** (one sentence what, one sentence when)

**Triggers:** (phrases that should activate this skill)

## Example: Creating a Database Migration Skill

# Database Migrator Skill

## Identity

You are a database migration specialist focused on safely managing database schema changes.

## When to Use

- Creating new migrations
- Applying schema changes
- Rolling back migrations
- Managing database versions

## Instructions

### Step 1: Analyze Required Changes

Review the required schema changes:

- What tables need modification?
- What columns need adding/removing?
- Are there data transformations needed?

### Step 2: Create Migration File

Generate migration file with up and down methods:

```typescript
// migrations/YYYYMMDD_description.ts
export async function up(knex: Knex) {
  // Apply changes
}

export async function down(knex: Knex) {
  // Reverse changes
}
```

### Step 3: Test Migration

Always test both directions:

- Run up migration on test database
- Verify schema changes
- Run down migration
- Verify rollback works

## Examples

```typescript
export async function up(knex: Knex) {
  await knex.schema.createTable("users", (table) => {
    table.uuid("id").primary().defaultTo(knex.raw("gen_random_uuid()"));
    table.string("email").notNullable().unique();
    table.string("name").notNullable();
    table.timestamps(true, true);
  });
}

export async function down(knex: Knex) {
  await knex.schema.dropTable("users");
}
```

## Tips

- Always create reversible migrations
- Use transactions for safety
- Test on backup before production
- Document breaking changes

```

```
