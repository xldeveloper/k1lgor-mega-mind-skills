# Receiving Code Review Skill

## When to Use

- After receiving code review feedback
- When addressing review comments
- When responding to requested changes

## Instructions

### Step 1: Read and Understand

1. **Read all comments** before responding
2. **Understand the intent** behind each comment
3. **Categorize feedback** by type:
   - Must fix (blocking issues)
   - Should fix (important improvements)
   - Consider (suggestions)
   - Questions (need clarification)

### Step 2: Respond Professionally

For each comment:

```markdown
**Status:** [Addressed / Discussing / Won't Fix]

**Response:**
[Your explanation or the fix applied]

**Change:** (if applicable)
[Link to the commit or describe the change]
```

### Step 3: Make Changes

1. **Create a checklist** of items to address
2. **Fix issues** in logical groups
3. **Add new tests** if needed
4. **Self-review** again before pushing

### Step 4: Follow Up

1. **Mark conversations resolved**
2. **Request re-review** if significant changes
3. **Thank reviewers** for their time

## Feedback Categories and Responses

### Must Fix (Blocking)

```markdown
**Comment:** "This has a security vulnerability - user input isn't validated"

**Response:**
✅ **Addressed**
Added input validation using the validateInput middleware. All user-provided strings are now sanitized.

**Change:** Commit abc123
```

### Should Fix (Important)

```markdown
**Comment:** "This function is doing too much - consider breaking it up"

**Response:**
✅ **Addressed**
Split into three smaller functions: parseInput, validateData, and saveRecord. Each has a single responsibility.

**Change:** Commit def456
```

### Consider (Suggestion)

```markdown
**Comment:** "Could use a more descriptive variable name"

**Response:**
✅ **Addressed**
Renamed `x` to `processedItemCount` for clarity.

**Alternative:** Kept as is because this is a loop iterator and `i` is conventional. Open to changing if you feel strongly.
```

### Questions

```markdown
**Comment:** "Why did you choose this approach?"

**Response:**
🤔 **Discussing**
I chose this approach because:

1. It's consistent with the existing pattern
2. It's more performant for our use case
3. It's easier to test

Happy to discuss alternatives if you have concerns.
